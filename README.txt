### Project Title
D6roller

### Description
This project is a python script (numpy/pandas) that takes in user input from command line to generate random dice (d6) rolls.

Users are asked if they would like to roll again.

Some statistics are provided (mean for each roll and historical mean at end of session).

### Credits
100% my own work so far - however credit to Davis E. Ford for the idea for historical mean at session end.
